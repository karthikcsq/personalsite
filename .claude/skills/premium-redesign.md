# Premium Frontend Redesign Skill

Apply this skill when redesigning the frontend to achieve a sleek, premium, minimalist aesthetic.

## Icon Guidelines

- Remove ALL emojis from the codebase
- Replace exclusively with Lucide-React icons
- No other icon libraries are permitted

## Spacing & Layout Principles

- Fix spacing and padding with precision
- No elements should feel cramped
- No unnecessary empty space wasting the layout
- Every component must be positioned deliberately

## Aesthetic Vision

The overall look and feel must be:
- Sleek and premium
- Minimalist (think Swiss luxury spa aesthetic)
- Professional enough that a working professional would pay thousands per month for
- Refined and elegant - something that would make Steve Jobs smile

## Color Philosophy

- Choose a single, cohesive color palette
- Stick to it consistently across the entire frontend
- Avoid excess and distraction
- Ensure visual harmony throughout

## Responsiveness Requirements

- Must adapt gracefully to ALL screen sizes
- From large desktop monitors to tablets and mobile devices
- Preserve the same elegance, spacing, and usability everywhere
- Responsiveness is non-negotiable

## Implementation Approach

When applying this skill:
1. Audit current components for emojis and replace with appropriate Lucide-React icons
2. Establish a design system with consistent spacing tokens
3. Define the color palette upfront
4. Apply changes systematically across all pages
5. Test thoroughly at multiple breakpoints
